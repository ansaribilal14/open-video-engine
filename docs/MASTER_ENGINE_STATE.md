WAVE: 0.6 COMPLETE (takeover audit + CI SIGILL resolution + contract reconciliation)
DATE: 2026-09-28
COMMIT: this wave landed via PR #2 (merge hash recorded in the merge commit)

## Session verification record (2026-09-28, independent takeover continuation)

Prior session claims were re-verified from scratch before any new work:

- HEAD `8b5aa81` on main; takeover baseline `33fde9d` IS an ancestor; tree clean.
- GitHub Actions: post-merge main run 36304812153 GREEN (and PR #1 runs
  36303605420 / 36304226310 GREEN) — W0.5 SIGILL fix confirmed externally.
- Local (system FFmpeg 7.1.5 path, unprivileged recipe per DEV_ENV.md):
  60/60 tests GREEN · fmt GREEN · clippy -D warnings GREEN (pre-W0.6 tree).
- Sources re-read: ove-time (297 l), ove-timeline (2303 l), ove-media (1332 l),
  ove-decode (145 l + conformance/probe suites). Spec set re-read: PROJECT_
  FORMAT / ENCODER / DECODER / FRAME_CONTRACT / MEDIA_ENGINE.

## WAVE 0.6 deltas (this session)

1. ove-time overflow policy DECIDED + pinned (ADR-007 amendment 2026-09-28):
   **overflow = contract violation = PANIC (fail-fast); never wraps, never
   saturates.** Rationale: saturation is silent approximation (fatal to E-002
   exactness); fixed-tick-axis discipline makes overflow a caller bug; p3b
   already asserted the panic. Doc drift (crate header said "saturates") fixed.
2. ove-time i64::MIN holes FIXED (real bugs found by the takeover re-audit):
   - `neg()`: `-i64::MIN` wrapped silently (release) — now checked_neg + panic
     with explicit contract message.
   - `gcd64/gcd128`: `.abs()` on i64::MIN/i128::MIN overflowed — gcd now
     computed on unsigned magnitudes.
   - `Rational::new(i64::MIN, n)` normalizes correctly end-to-end now.
3. Property suite extended P1–P10 → P1–P12: P11 extreme-safety (MIN/MAX
   construct/cmp/half/floor_div_rate/split/add/serde), P12 overflow-panics
   (neg/sub/add/mul/floor_div_rate) + must-NOT-panic exact-boundary guard.
4. Hash terminology single-policy reconciliation (audit gap #1b):
   PROJECT_FORMAT_SPEC §2 now carries a normative HASH POLICY (BLAKE3-256,
   64 lowercase hex, = ove-media ContentHash; sha256 confined to golden-
   artifact TEST tooling), §2 manifest example `sha256`→`content_hash`,
   §5 `assets/<sha256>/`→`assets/<content-hash>/`; ENCODER_SPEC E-5 +
   muxer finalize() annotated "artifact integrity, not identity".

## CI CONFIRMATION (2026-09-27, prior wave)

- PR #1 run 36303605420: ALL 3 JOBS GREEN (fresh portable build; wrapper
  marker present; guard scanned 1445 objects PASS; conformance 14/14).
- Post-merge main run 36304226310: ALL 3 JOBS GREEN — the original failure
  scenario (cache restored from another runner) now passes with portable
  artifacts; conformance 14/14; portability guard PASS.

## Current implementation inventory

| Crate | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| ove-time | TESTED — 6 unit + 18 property (P1–P12, extreme/overflow contract pinned) | 67/67 local (2026-09-28) + CI |
| ove-timeline | TESTED — 10 properties, AVL primary (ADR-011) | CI + local; bench in ADR-011 |
| ove-media | TESTED — 13 unit (asset hash, FrameEnvelope, pool, probe types) | CI + local |
| ove-decode | TESTED — 14 conformance (D-1..D-12) + 6 probe; libav confined | CI + local, both system and bundled libav |
| ove-render / ove-encode / ove-project / ove-engine / ove-cli | PLANNED (waves 2–5 per ENGINE_BUILD_PLAN) | — |

## Current research / architecture status

- ADR-001/002/007/008/009/010/011/012 ACCEPTED; ADR-003/004/005/006 PROPOSED
  with named evidence legs. ADR-007 carries the 2026-09-28 overflow-policy
  amendment.
- 45 research docs + 137-source ledger + gates (13 UNDERSTOOD / 1 PARTIAL env-bound).
- Architecture residuals (named, not hidden): E-005 real-GPU perf, E-004c device
  runtime, E-006b real-Tauri transport — all hardware/environment-bound.

## Current validation status

- 67/67 workspace tests GREEN locally (system FFmpeg 7.1.5 path), fmt GREEN,
  clippy -D warnings GREEN, after W0.6 changes (2026-09-28).
- Bundled path: exercised by CI on the PR for this wave (same pure-Rust diff —
  no libav interaction; PR run is the gate).
- CI: last green 36304812153 (main, pre-W0.6); W0.6 PR run to be recorded in
  the merge commit message.

## Current CI state

- Workflow: fmt + clippy + tests (bundled) + portability guard + cargo-audit
  + libav-confinement. Cache prefix `v2-portable-ffmpeg` (poisoned caches
  unreachable).

## Current blockers

- None environmental.

## Current open gaps (top)

1. WAVE 1 media↔timeline seam hardening (next implementation wave).
2. ove-render (software reference first) — directive §11, after W1.
3. Mutation-style "test the tests" not yet systematic.
4. Hardware-bound experiment residuals (E-004c/E-005/E-006b).
5. GitHub PAT used across chat sessions must be rotated by the owner
   (standing security rule, DEV_ENV.md) — outside engine scope, flagged.

## Current wave order (directive §37, unchanged)

0 audit ✓ → 0.5 SIGILL ✓ → 0.6 reconcile ✓ → 1 seam → 2 render →
3 encode+mux+export → 4 project → 5 engine+cli → 6 vertical slice →
7 audio → 8 keyframes → 9 GPU → 10–12 platforms → 13 conformance →
14 headless → 15 AI/MCP → 16 scripting → 17 plugins → 18 security →
19 perf → 20 docs/release → 21 production audit.

## Resolved decisions (registry)

- ADR-012 (2026-09-27): CI bundled-FFmpeg portability — wrapper + cache prefix
  + guard. Confidence 0.92. Reopen condition: ffmpeg-sys-next flag change (guard
  fails loudly) or CI SIGILL recurrence.
- ADR-007 amendment (2026-09-28): ove-time overflow policy = intentional panic
  (fail-fast); i64::MIN safe except negation (panics); checked variants deferred
  to first non-panicking consumer. Confidence 0.93. Reopen condition: an FFI
  consumer that cannot tolerate panics forces the checked-variant conversation.
- Hash policy (2026-09-28): BLAKE3-256 is the ONLY identity hash (assets +
  state); sha256 exists only in golden-artifact test tooling / render-record
  integrity fingerprints. Confidence 0.97 (code truth was already BLAKE3).

## Unresolved decisions (registry)

- NLE derived-verb surface (ripple/roll/slip/slide/insert/overwrite/extract/lift):
  record primitive-vs-derived table when timeline work resumes (directive §6.2) —
  not before.

## Explicit next action

WAVE 1 — media↔timeline seam hardening: read ENGINE_BUILD_PLAN wave-1 section,
verify the seam contract (AssetRef/StreamId ↔ timeline clip source references;
exact time conversion at ingest onto the project tick axis), implement with
property tests, keep fmt/clippy/tests green, land via PR, update this file,
then start WAVE 2 (ove-render software reference renderer).
